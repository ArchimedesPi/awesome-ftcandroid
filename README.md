## Libraries

Stuff for storing data :)
### Data structures
- [Tape](http://square.github.io/tape/): Fast FIFO queues

Databases let you persist your robot's state over multiple runs, and store data persistently.
### Databases
- [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-java): An popular, easy-to-use Android database
- [Sugar ORM](http://satyan.github.io/sugar/index.html): An easy way of using the built-in SQLite database in Android

Dependency Injection makes it easier to write Java without "FactoryFactory" classes,
and makes reusing code easier.
### Dependency Injection
- [Dagger](http://square.github.io/dagger/)

It's *really* nice that we have a camera this year.
Vision libraries let you do object tracking and cool stuff like that.
### Vision Libraries
- [FastCV](https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/fast-cv-sdk): Qualcomm's Snapdragon-tailored vision SDK
- [OpenCV(4Android)](http://opencv.org/platforms/android.html): OpenCV for Android

### Utilities
- [Apache Commons](https://commons.apache.org/): A collection of useful Java utils
- [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava): Google's collection of useful Java utils
- [Retrolambda](https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda): Use cool new Java 8 features on Java 7 and below (because we're using Java 7 phones)
